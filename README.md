*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Train and test models on a large, well-structured corpus.
*   **Text Analytics and Mining:** Perform sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and frequency analysis.
*   **Data Science and Visualization:** Explore character arcs, dialogue patterns, and narrative structures.
*   **Educational Purposes:** A perfect resource for teaching text processing and data science concepts.

**Note:** This material is copyrighted and is provided strictly for educational and non-commercial use.

üìÇ Dataset Structure
===================
*   `Complete_Harry_Potter.txt`: A single plain text file containing the combined text of all seven books.
